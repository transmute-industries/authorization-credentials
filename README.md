# Authorization Credentials

This is a hypothetical extension to the [VC Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) to support [Authorization Capabilities](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/) as Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations.

The main goal is to show how small changes to the VC Data Model would allow existing toolign to be used to create authorization capabilities.

### Getting Started

```
npm i
npm run test
```
