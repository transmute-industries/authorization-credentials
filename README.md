# Authorization Credentials

This is a hypothetical extension to the [VC Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) to support [Authorization Capabilities](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/) as Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations.

The main goal is to show how small changes to the VC Data Model would allow existing tooling to be used to create, delegate and invoke authorization capabilities.

### Getting Started

```
npm i
npm run test
```
